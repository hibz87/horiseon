# Assignment-1# 
# Title

I have been asked to refactor the code for a functional website, the website needed a title. I have chosen to name it after the company logo 'Horiseon'.

# Challenges 
 The main challenges I faced was making sure that the site was still looking the same as it did previously as I had to learn that any change I made had a direct impact on how the website looked like. 
 
# Things I learned

I have learned about the section tag, the importance of catering to all kinds of people to enable accessibility to websites and I have learned to track changes as I had to track back a lot if I wrote any part of the code wrong.
